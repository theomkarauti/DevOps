Helm is a pkg manager that used to install third party software to your cluster & K8s controller manager.

Over time, the Kubernetes community discovered that creating and maintaining
Kubernetes resources to deploy applications is difficult. This prompted the development
of a simple yet powerful tool that would allow teams to overcome the challenges posed by
deploying applications on Kubernetes. The tool that was created is called Helm. Helm is an
open-source tool used for packaging and deploying applications on Kubernetes. It is often
referred to as the Kubernetes Package Manager because of its similarities to any other
package manager you would find on your favourite OS. Helm is widely used throughout the
Kubernetes community and is a CNCF graduated project.
